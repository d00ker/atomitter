#atomitter#
**atomitter** is just a wrapper for Twitter Web Client (aka [twitter.com](https://twitter.com)) based on [Atom Shell](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell)

Why should one use it? Because atomitter suppots all twitter features right after twitter adds them to its own site and it's better than just a browser tab! It's a separate app!

####Pros:####

- It's open source (and free)
- Supports all twitter features
- It's better than just a browser tab!
- It's even better than the official twitter client because we added some extra features.
- ...

####Cons:####

- Slower than native apps
- Can't synchronise clients on different devices
- Ads 😐 (potentially fixable)

To run the app one can execute `sudo ./build.sh` (to build atomitter using atom shell sources) 
Or just download the [latest](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/releases/latest) version of Atom.app and drag-n-drop atomitter folder to it.

Later we're going to create fully functional app.

If you have a question/suggestion/advice or just want to talk you can always write to [@evlogii](https://twitter.com/evlogii) or feel free to create an issue here on github.

Cheers!
