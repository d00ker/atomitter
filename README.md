**atomitter** it's just wrapper for Twitter Web Client (aka [twitter.com](https://twitter.com)) based on [Atom Shell](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell)

Why you should use it? Because atomitter support all twitter feature right after twitter add it to his own site and it better than just tab in browser! It's separate app!

####Pros:####

- It's open source (and free) forever
- Support all twitter features
- Its better than just tab in browser
- Its even better than official twitter client because we add some features
- ...

####Cons:####

- Slower than native apps
- Can't synchronise clients on different devices
- Ads üòê [potentially fixed :-]

To run app you can execute: `$ ./build.sh` (build atomitter using atom shell sources)  
Or: Just download [latest](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/releases/latest) verions of Atom.app and drag-n-drop atomitter folder to it.

We'll create full functionaled native app later.

If you have a question/suggestion/advice or just want to talk you can always write to [@evlogii](https://twitter.com/evlogii) or feel free to create an issue here on github.

Cheers!
