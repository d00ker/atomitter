**atomitter** it's just wrapper for Twitter Web Client (aka [twitter.com](https://twitter.com)) based on [Atom Shell](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell)

Why you should use it? Because atomitter support all twitter feature right after twitter add it to his own site and it better than just tab in browser! It's separate app!

####Pros:####

- It's open source (and free) forever!
- Support all twitter features!
- Its better than just tab in browser.
- Its even better than official twitter client because we add some features
- ...

####Cons:####

- Slower than native apps
- Can't synchronise clients on different devices
- ads üòê [potentially fixed :-]

We'll don't create functionaled .app file until first stable realse, so you should perform this in console:

1. `$ ./build.sh` (it just download atom.app through [grunt](https://github.com/atom/grunt-download-atom-shell))
2. `$ ./run_app.sh` (you can see what it does by reading script)

If you have a question/suggestion/advice or just want to talk you can always write to [@evlogii](https://twitter.com/evlogii) or (better) feel free to create an issue here on github.

Cheers!

ToDo list:
  1. Favorites in top left menu
  2. Add quote retweet
  3. Add support of third party images(instagram, imgur, all gpegs at least)
  4. open window at the same place with same size
